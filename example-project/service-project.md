# Service Project

Testinium supports Karate, Java, Gauge and Cucumber frameworks for service testing.

For the framework you want to run, a Service project is created with the Create New Project steps from the Project screen.



**Service Karate**

There should definitely be one java class in the service test written with Karate.

Cucumber steps should be in the src->resources->features directory.

**Java Service**

In Java service tests, no action different from what is known is required. The Java service test, which is written, can be run as it is written.

**Cucumber Service**

It should be the same as a normal cucumber project. There should be a Cucumber Runner class and feature files should be under src->resources->features folder.
